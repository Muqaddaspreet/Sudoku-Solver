# Sudoku Solver
This project primarily focuses on solving sudoku puzzles with full accuracy and efficiency by using a backtracking algorithm. Language used-Python.

Backtracking algorithm- Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time by removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree).
